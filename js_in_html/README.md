## < script > 
The primary method of inserting JavaScript into an HTML page.

There are eight attributes:  
- `async` (optional)
  - Triggers the script for immediate download, concurrently with other 
  actions as to avoid prevention of processes such as downloading of 
  resources or waiting for other scripts to load.
  - Valid only for external script files.
